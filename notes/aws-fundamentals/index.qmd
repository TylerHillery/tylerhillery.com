## Review 

**Rating**: ⭐⭐⭐⭐

Very good hands on introduction to the most important services of AWS. There were a few commands I thought were glossed over during the setup of certain resources such as implementing the proper security group rules on the default VPC. Otherwise, I thought the book did a great job explaining many of the core AWS products, their uses cases, and real-world examples. I would recommend this to someone getting start with AWS.

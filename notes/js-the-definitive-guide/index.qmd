# Notes

## Chapter 03: Types, Values and Variables

I find it interesting that `null` is of type object yet other special values like `undefined`, `Infinity` and `NaN` are just global constants.

Does `Array.from()` do a deep copy? By deep I mean if it has array of arrays or object with values as objects.

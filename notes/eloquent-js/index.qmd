# Notes

## Chapter 1. Values, Types and Operators

JavaScript stores `Number` type as 64 bits.

JavaScript has three "special" numbers, `Infinity` `-`Infinity` and `NaN`.

JavaScript uses the *Unicode* standard for strings, but it uses the 16 bits version which can complicate things that are outside the 16 bit range such as emojis taking two "character positions".

JavaScript uses `null` and `undefined` as special values to denote "emptiness".

For coalescing the main difference between using `||` vs `??` is `||` tests if the left value is "truthy" so if the value is `0` it will be false is choose the default. Often times this is not what we want and instead should use `??` which checks if the value is `null` or `undefined`.

```js
console.log(0 || 100);
// --> 100

console.log(0 ?? 100);
// --> 0 

console.log(null ?? 100);
// --> 100
```

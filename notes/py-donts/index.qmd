# Notes

## Zip Up

- `zip` goes until the shortest of the iterators provided
- In Python 3.10> you can use a `strict` keyword to error if the length of iterators don't match

```{python}
firsts = ["Tyler", "Chandra"]
lasts = ["Hillery", "Hillery", "Hill"]

try:
    for z in zip(firsts, lasts, strict=True):
        print(z)
except Exception as e:
    print(e)
```

- The error doesn't occur until the end when the mismatch occurs because zip is lazily evaluated
- Interesting, you can use `zip` inside `dict` to make key,value pair of the iterators passed in

### **About Me**

I pride myself as a *Lifelong Learner*.

I currently work at [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) as a Data Engineer.

My ambition is to help build systems, infrastructure and technology that empowers others.

I'm driven by gratitude.

### **Background**

Before pursuing a tech career, I wanted to work in investment management. I graduated with a B.S. in Finance in December 2019.

My first job out of college was in the investment management department of a Fortune 650 insurance company, working in investment operations and helping manage our money market portfolio. It wasn't until I passed the [CFA](https://www.cfainstitute.org/en/programs/cfa/charter) level 1 exam that I knew this career wasn't for me. What I did discover was my interest in computer science, data, and technology.

In Summer 2021, I started working on my technical skills outside of work through various resources (Books, YouTube, etc.). My favorite way to learn is by first getting a general high-level understanding of a topic and then diving into building [projects](https://www.tylerhillery.com/projects.html).

In today's software development world, we build upon many layers of abstractions. I do my best to peel back each layer to understand the core fundamentals, principles, and patterns that stay true across technologies.

While most of my background has been in various data roles, I don't let that define who I am. I continuously learn about different domains, such as web development, software internals, DevOps, networking, etc.

With that being said, these are some of my favorite topics to learn about:

-   Customer-Facing Analytics
-   Data Streaming
-   Event Driven Architecture
-   Ruthless Automation
-   Database Internals

Outside of tech:

-   I have a beautiful wife who has a passion for bodybuilding
-   I have a twin brother
-   Recently moved to Scottsdale, Arizona 🌵
-   Big fan of the Milwaukee Bucks #BucksIn6 🦌
-   I co-authored a paper [Inside the hiring process: how managers assess employability based on grit, the big five, and other factors](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/335182644_Inside_the_hiring_process_how_managers_assess_employability_based_on_grit_the_big_five_and_other_factors)

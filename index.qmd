### **About Me**
Currently working at [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) as a Data Engineer.

Lifelong learner passionate about understanding the "*how*" and "*why*" behind software by peeling back the layers of abstraction. My interests span infrastructure, data systems, observability, testing, debugging and product.

Driven by curiosity, grounded in gratitude.

### **Background**

Before tech, I studied finance and started my career in investment operations. After 1.5 years, I realized I was more interested in computers, software, and data.

In 2021, I pivoted into software engineering and began teaching myself programming through books, videos and online courses. My favorite way to learn is by first getting a general high-level understanding of a topic and then diving into building [projects](https://tylerhillery.com/projects).

Early in my career, I worked in various data related roles, leveraging my finance background. While I enjoyed working with data, I often felt removed from the actual product and my impact wasn't as clear. 

Over time, I became more drawn to the bigger picture of how software is built and operated to deliver real value to users. That curiosity has pulled me deeper into software engineering, where I can work closer to the product, tackle technically challenging problems, and more easily see the impact of my contributions. 

Today, I'm focused on growing as a software engineer and operator, combining my broad curiosity and pragmatic mindset to build and operate the systems that great products depend on.

Outside of tech:

- I enjoy weight lifting üèãÔ∏èÔ∏è
- I have a beautiful wife who has a passion for health and fitness 
- I have a twin brother
- Grew up in Wisconsin üßÄ, spent a couple years in Arizona üåµ, and now back in Wisconsin 
- I co-authored a paper [Inside the hiring process: how managers assess employability based on grit, the big five, and other factors](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/335182644_Inside_the_hiring_process_how_managers_assess_employability_based_on_grit_the_big_five_and_other_factors)

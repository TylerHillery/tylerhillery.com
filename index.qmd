### **About Me**
Currently working at [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) as a Data Engineer.

Lifelong learner passionate about understanding the "*how*" and "*why*" behind software by peeling back the layers of abstraction. My interests span infrastructure, data systems and product. I'm energized by seeing things through from idea to production.

Driven by curiosity, grounded in gratitude.

### **Background**

Before tech, I studied finance and started my career in investment operations. After 1.5 years, I realized I was more interested in computers, software, and data.

In 2021, I pivoted into software engineering and began teaching myself programming through books, videos and online courses. My favorite way to learn is by first getting a general high-level understanding of a topic and then diving into building [projects](https://tylerhillery.com/projects).

Early in my career, I worked in various data related roles, leveraging my finance background. While I enjoyed working with data, I often felt removed from the actual product and my impact wasn't as clear. 

Over time, I became more drawn to the bigger picture of how software is built and operated to deliver real value to users. That curiosity has pulled me deeper into software engineering, where I can work closer to the product, tackle technically challenging problems, and more easily see the impact of my contributions. 

Today, I'm focused on growing as a software engineer, combining my broad curiosity and pragmatic mindset to build great products and the foundations that support them, whether that‚Äôs working on data systems, backend services, infrastructure, or front-end user experience. 

Outside of tech:

- I enjoy weight lifting üèãÔ∏èÔ∏è
- I have a beautiful wife who has a passion for health and fitness 
- I have a twin brother
- Recently moved to Arizona üåµ but original from Wisconsin üßÄ
- I co-authored a paper [Inside the hiring process: how managers assess employability based on grit, the big five, and other factors](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/335182644_Inside_the_hiring_process_how_managers_assess_employability_based_on_grit_the_big_five_and_other_factors)
